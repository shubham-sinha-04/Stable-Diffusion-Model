# Stable Diffusion ‚Äì My Implementation (PyTorch)

This repository contains my implementation and experiments with **Stable Diffusion**,  
based on the open-source project [hkproj/pytorch-stable-diffusion](https://github.com/hkproj/pytorch-stable-diffusion),  
licensed under the **MIT License**.

---

## üß† Project Overview
- Implemented and tested locally using **VS Code**.
- Explored **text-to-image generation** using Stable Diffusion in PyTorch.
- Each image below was generated using custom creative prompts.
- Added generated outputs and saved them in the `/results/` folder.

## üñºÔ∏è Results

| Prompt Description | Generated Image |
|:--------------------|:----------------|
| **1. Batman Character**<br>`"A realistic Batman standing tall under a cloudy sky, cinematic lighting, ultra-detailed, 8k resolution, hyperrealistic style."` | ![Batman](results/Batman.jpeg) |
| **2. Fruits Composition**<br>`"A vibrant composition of bananas, oranges, and peaches on a lush green background, studio lighting, ultra-sharp, 8k resolution, photorealistic style."` | ![Fruits](results/Fruits.jpeg) |
| **3. Mountain Landscape**<br>`"Snow-covered mountains at sunrise, warm light hitting the peaks, highly detailed, dramatic composition, ultra sharp, 8k cinematic landscape."` | ![Mountain](results/Mountain.jpeg) |
| **4. Cat Portrait**<br>`"A cat with sunglasses, wearing comfy hat, looking at camera, highly detailed, ultra sharp, cinematic, 100mm lens, 8k resolution."` | ![Cat](results/Cat.jpeg) |
